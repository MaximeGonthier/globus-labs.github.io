description: "Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to conduct large scale science. However, the method by which infrastructure is provisioned and managed are ad hoc. We are developing new methods to profile application performance, predict cloud market conditions, and automate provisioning decisions."

The Computing Continuum is the idea that increasingly fast networks enable substantial access to distributed compute resources, including the cloud, 
high performance computers (HPC), and the edge. Fluid computing across the continuum allows scientists and users to best utilize the resources that they 
have access to by pushing compute tasks to all resources rather than just one at a time. While novel methods and technologies have put this dream within reach,
substantial hurdles are still necessary to cross in order to put this in the hands of of compute users everywhere.

The Scalable Cost-Aware Cloud Infrastructure Management and Provisioning (SCRIMP) project aimed to address these challenges by developing new, more efficient cloud provisioning methods and integrating these new methods into automated cloud and HPC access tools. Now, the Distributed Execution of Lambdas with Tradeoff Analysis (DELTA) project encompasses the cloud-specific methodologies developed through SCRIMP along with cutting edge techniques using serverless computing to push compute everywhere in the computing continuum.

Our research focuses on four core areas:
(1) developing profiling methods to characterize workload execution characteristics;
(2) exploring tradeoffs in computational cost across computing resources, from cloud to edge, in order to inform intelligent resource selection; and 
(3) creating an automated cost-aware provisioning service using serverless infrastructure to deploy tasks on diverse computing resources based on time, monetary, and service cost constraints.
